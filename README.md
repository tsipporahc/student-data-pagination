# student-data-pagination
 Techdegree Unit 2 Project

About: This project was created to paginate and filter student data information on a page. By creating DOM elements, I displayed nine students' data onto a page. I created and appended pagination buttons for users to easily browse through the student data list. 

Challenges: I faced a roadblock when it came to correctly setting the page to display 9 students at a time, but I was about to overcome it with small changes in my comparison condition. I also faced challenges targeting the correct element for the pagination buttons to respond to users clicks. I had a tough time programming the functionality of the button focus so that when you move from one page to another, the page you are on focus and other does not.
